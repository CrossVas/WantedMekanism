# About this mod

This mod adds some wanted features for Mekanism's Tools and Armors.

Atomic Disassembler:
 - Made Atomic Disassembler enchantable. 
 - Also, it has two modes: Silk Mode and Fortune Mode (Sneak Key + Right Click).  
 - Added the ability to place torches on right click.

Armored Jetpack:
 - Changed the way Armored Jetpack works:
   - You can switch jetpack state on/off just by pressing Mode Switch Key.
   - You can switch jetpack mode hover/normal just by pressing Space + Mode Switch Key.

# Plans

At this point everything I wanted is already implemented.
