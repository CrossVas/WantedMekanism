> About this mod

This mod adds some wanted features for Mekanism's Tools and Armors.

Atomic Disassembler:
 - added ability to enchant it (yes, I know, it's OP);
 - added ability to switch between Silk and Fortune mode (yes...);

Armored Jetpack:
Changed the way Armored Jetpack works.
You can switch jetpack state on/off just by pressing Mode Switch Key.
You can switch jetpack mode hover/normal just by pressing Space + Mode Switch Key.

> Plans

At this point everything I wanted is already implemented.
